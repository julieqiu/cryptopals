Single-byte XOR cipher

The hex encoded string:

  1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736

... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the
message.

You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you.

How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character
frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the
best score.

Basics


Decryption: XOR has a property - if

  a = b ^ c
  // then
  b = a ^ c

As a result, the decryption process is exactly the same as the encryption.e.

We iterate through the encrypted message bytewise and XOR each byte with the
encryption key - the resultant will be the original message.

ETAOIN SHRDLU is the approximate order of frequency of the 12 most commonly used letters
in the English language. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu


Solution

Like in challenge 2, start by decoding the string to bytes.
